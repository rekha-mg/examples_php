  <h2>Meditation</h2>
  <h2>Creating Time and Developing Focus</h2>
<p> When teaching Reiki classes I often speak of “my Reiki meditations”. 
 This stirs questions and comments from many of the students. 
 Frequently students exclaim “I just can’t meditate”, “My mind is always wandering”, 
 “I don’t have time to meditate”, “How do I use Reiki to help me learn to meditate”,
  “I’ve meditated for years, why do I need to use Reiki?”

It wasn’t until I began incorporating Reiki into my meditations that I began
 to feel like I was really accomplishing something.  
 I happen to be a Gemini with an Aquarius moon, talk about mental chatter!
  So if I can learn to meditate with the help of Reiki, I believe anyone can!  .</p>


<h2>The purpose of meditation</h2>
<p>
First let’s consider the purpose of meditation and the forms it can take.
  Meditation is the art of creating a quiet mind and listening to the sound of silence. 
   Where prayer is the act of talking with the Divine, meditation is the act of listening 
   and truly hearing what God has to share with us. This can take place during special sacred 
   moments that you set aside specifically for the purpose of meditation, or spontaneously.
    Activities when spontaneous meditations often occur are while brushing your teeth, 
    in the shower, hiking, running, washing the dishes, mowing the lawn and yes, we have
     all had those auto-pilot moments while driving the car. </p>

  <h2>Healing</h2>
  <p class="w3-container"> Healing (literally meaning to make whole[1]) is the process of the restoration of health from an 
    unbalanced, diseased or damaged organism.
<br> 
With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living tissue, organs and the biological system as a whole and resumption of normal functioning. It is the process by which the cells in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form similar tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue. Most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms.
<br>
It is also referred to in the context of the grieving process.
<br><br>
<br><br>
In psychiatry and psychology, healing is the process by which neuroses and psychoses are resolved to the degree that the client is able to lead a normal or fulfilling existence without being overwhelmed by psychopathological phenomena. This process may involve psychotherapy, pharmaceutical treatment or alternative approaches such as traditional spiritual healing..</p>
